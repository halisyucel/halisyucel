## Hi, I'm **Halis** 👋

Currently, I'm a software crafter with a focus on front-end development. I specialize in developing enterprise-grade application frontends using TypeScript and React. In addition to my technical stack, I have an interest in Java, and I make a daily effort to improve my skills in this area. 👨‍💻

I am also a first-year student of Computer Engineering at Hacettepe University. 🎓
