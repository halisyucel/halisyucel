# Hey, I'm Halis

I'm a software developer and co-founder who loves building things. Currently running [Withertz](https://withertz.com), an AI-native SaaS portfolio company where we identify market gaps and ship focused products fast. Right now we're building [Fanqer](https://fanqer.com) — an AI assistant for social media creators — and [Landwait](https://landwait.com) — a tool that generates landing pages and waitlists from a single prompt so you can validate ideas before writing a single line of code. I'm also a 4th year Computer Engineering student at Hacettepe University, 7 years into this degree and still going.
