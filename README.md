## Hi, I'm **Halis Yücel** 👋

It has been about three years since I started my software adventure, which I started as a hobby, and I am quite intent on doing this professionally.

I started this journey with **Python** and continued by learning **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**. Of course, it would not be right to say that I learned completely. After all, it's an ongoing process. 🤗

I continue to dive into the depths of the frontend world with **React + Typescript** and try to improve myself every day. 👨‍💻

Nowadays I'm working on frameworks like **Next.js**. **Jamstack** architecture is very interesting to me. And I believe this will be a big part of web development in the future. 👾

I continue my university education, which I started at Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, from Hacettepe University Computer Engineering. 🎓
